## 🔧 Technical Features

### Multiplier Calculation
The game uses a provably fair multiplier system:

const calculateMultiplier = (mineCount, gemsFound) => {
    const totalTiles = 25;
    const safeTiles = totalTiles - mineCount;
    let multiplier = 1;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < gemsFound; i++) {
        const remaining = safeTiles - i;
        const odds = remaining / (totalTiles - i);
        multiplier *= (1 / odds) * 0.97; // 3% house edge
    }
    
    return Math.max(1, multiplier);
};
```
